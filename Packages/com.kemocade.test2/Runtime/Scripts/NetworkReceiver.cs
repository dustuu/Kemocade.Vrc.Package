         * Delete/Comment out the example below but keep the two variables above
         * If you wish to send response to a method you receive you can use reference to NetworkManager to do so.

         * This Behaviour has a SyncMode set to None so you do not need to worry about your Methods needing and underscore.
         * All methods NEED to be made public with return type void
